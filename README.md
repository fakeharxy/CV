## Paul Harker

Technical Writer, Help-System Designer and part-time coder. Eight years experience writing customer-facing software documentation and developer-facing API / integration guides, and now about a year coding with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with a little bit of React around the edges.

## Achievements

- Created, from scratch, many help systems using a variety of Technical Writing packages.
- Written many, many technical User Guides, Campaign Briefs, Doc Specs, API Guides, Help Systems/Servers, HTML helps etc. etc.
- Been part of teams that have completely redesigned existing help systems to focus on user-engagement, multiple outputs or converting to DITA methodologies.
- Completed [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), an intensive 12 week coding course that allows people without a coding background to get to the stage where they can test-drive the development of web apps. 
- Code Club: having completed the course above, I ran monthly code meetups for non-technical staff at North Highland, providing insight into their developers' workflow.

## Skills

#### Technical Writing

Both in a team, using Jira in an Agile environment, and working solo, including owning my own LTD for contracting purposes. Communicated with stakeholders, ran usability testing, liased with developers about features, and completed release notes and all documentation for many software products.

- Created [documentation in Wordpress](http://www.netbiscuits.com/knowledge-base/) with DITA methodologies, as the sole technical author of Netbiscuits, a mobile analytics company.

#### Technical Writing Technologies

Having used a multitude of technologies to create technical documentation, I have somehow acquired a genuine interest in learning new ways to deliver help content:

- Madcap Flare, in which I am certified, focusing on content reuse for multiple outputs using single-sourcing, context-sensitive help and variables.
- Also proficient in Adobe Robohelp, a Help Authoring Tool similar to Flare.
- HTML solutions including [FlatDoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) and [Fixie Docs](http://philips.github.io/fixiedocs/).
- Backend CMS solutions like Jekyll, Wordpress or XSL/XML using DITA.
- Recently, using Github pages and simple Markdown to create developer-facing Github readmes (like this one!).
- Very familiar with Git and other version control systems.
- Will use Vim whenever anyone lets me.
